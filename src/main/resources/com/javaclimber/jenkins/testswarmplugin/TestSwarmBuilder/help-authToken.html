<div>
    <p>Token that was printed when the Project was created - Note that this is <b>not the one that appears on the jobs screen or in the database(that is the auth token after a sha1)</b>.
To regenerate a forgotten token, go to the Swarm Scripts folder and run <i>php refreshProjectToken.php --id="sampleProject"</i></p>
    
This will remove any previous tokens and generate a new one.
